# Song Lyrics Generator

The Song Lyrics Generator is a Python-based project that uses OpenAI's Whisper API to transcribe an audio file and then formats the text into properly formatted lyrics.

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following:

    1. Python 3
    2. Jupyter Notebook
    3. OpenAI API key

## Installation

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Create an account on OpenAI.
    3. Copy your OpenAI API key and paste it in the openai_key variable in the `Song_Lyrics_Generator.ipynb` file.
    4. Run the Jupyter Notebook by typing jupyter notebook in the terminal and opening the `Song_Lyrics_Generator.ipynb` file.

## Usage

    1. Open song_lyrics_generator.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
    2. Replace the path to the audio file with the path to your own file.
    3. Run the notebook cell by cell to generate the formatted lyrics.
  
## Example 

Here is the output given by the Bot for the song 'Kiwi' by Harry Styles
```
Verse 1:
She walked away through a Jeep pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bitter intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck, she's driving me crazy

Chorus:
But I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it, it's getting crazy
I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said, I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's none of your
It's none of your

Verse 2:
It's New York baby, always jacked up
Holla turn the floor and knows it's always backed up
When she's alone she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress, she's such an actress
Driving me crazy

Chorus:
But I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it, it's getting crazy
I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's none of your business
I'm having your baby
It's not a yawn, it's not a yawn

Verse 3:
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me till my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it
It's like I paid for it
I'm gonna pay for this

Chorus:
It's not a yawn, it's not a yawn
I'm in your business
It's not in your business
I'm in your business
It's not in your business
I'm in your business
I'm in your business
It's not in your business
I'm in your business
It's not in your business
